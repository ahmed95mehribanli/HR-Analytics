HR Attrition Analysis – Power BI Project


This repository contains my HR Attrition Analysis developed in Power BI. The purpose of this project is to examine the key factors contributing to employee turnover and provide clear, data-driven insights that can support HR decision-making. The dashboard allows users to explore attrition trends across demographics, job roles, compensation levels, satisfaction indicators, and work-life conditions.

Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical challenge for many organizations. By analyzing workforce patterns and identifying areas of concern, companies can take proactive steps to retain talent. In this project, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights how different variables(degrees, job satisfaction, gender, department, education field, and etc.) are related to the likelihood of employees leaving the company.

Key Insights

The Power BI report illustrates:

* Variation in attrition across departments and job roles.
* Higher turnover among specific age groups and employment categories.
* Relationships between satisfaction scores and the probability of leaving.
* Attrition rate by gender among different age groups
  
These insights allow HR teams to identify at-risk groups and design targeted retention strategies.

Data and Modeling

The report is based on a structured HR dataset(you can find in repository) frequently used for analytical demonstrations. I performed data cleaning, transformation, and modeling in Power Query and designed measures with DAX to calculate attrition metrics and comparisons. The data model is optimized for interactive analysis and dashboard performance.

Features of the Dashboard

* Dynamic KPIs summarizing total employees and attrition rates.
* Slicers for department, job role, education, gender, and age categories.
* Visual breakdowns of attrition by demographic and employment factors.
* Detailed analysis of satisfaction levels, income distribution, and overtime impact.
