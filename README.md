The purpose of this case study is to explore the "HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists" dataset and develop a predictive model to identify the factors that influence job change among data scientists. The study aims to provide insights into the key factors that can help organizations retain their data scientists and make better decisions related to employee retention and satisfaction.

•	Research Questions: 
The following research questions will guide our analysis:
o	What are the key factors that influence job change among data scientists?
o	Can we build a predictive model to identify employees who are likely to change jobs?
o	What insights can we gain from the data that can help organizations improve employee retention and satisfaction?

•	Significance: 
The significance of this case study lies in the insights it can provide to organizations about employee retention and satisfaction. In particular, the study focuses on data scientists, who are in high demand and play a critical role in organizations that rely on data analysis. The findings from this study can help organizations develop strategies to retain their data scientists and improve their overall HR analytics capabilities.








2.	Business Problem:

•	The HR department of a company wants to understand why their employees are leaving their current job and looking for new opportunities elsewhere. They want to identify the factors that contribute to employee attrition and take necessary actions to retain their valuable employees.
•	The focus of this case study is on data scientists, who are in high demand and short supply in the job market. It is essential for companies to understand what motivates data scientists to stay in their current role and what drives them to seek new job opportunities.
•	The successful completion of this project can provide insights into the factors that affect job satisfaction and help the HR department to take proactive measures to retain the company's valuable data scientists. It can also help to reduce recruitment and training costs associated with employee turnover.

3.	Data Description:

•	Data Source: 
‘job_change.csv’ - The "HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists" dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists), a well-known data science community. The dataset is collected through a survey conducted on the platform, where the participants are individuals who are or were employed as data scientists. The data includes their background, education, experience, and other relevant information, as well as whether or not they are currently looking for a new job or not.

•	Data Characteristics: 
The dataset contains 19,158 observations and 14 features. The features are a mix of categorical and numerical data. Some of the features include gender, education level, city development index, relevant experience, and company size.

•	Data Dictionary: 
The datasets include the following variables:
o	“enrollee_id”: unique ID for each participant (numeric)
o	“city”: city code of participant's location (categorical)
o	“city_development_index”: development index of the city (numeric)
o	“gender”: participant's gender (categorical: ‘Male’, ‘Female’, ‘Other’)
o	“relevent_experience”: participant's relevant experience (numeric)
o	“enrolled_university”: type of university enrolled in by participant (categorical: ‘no_enrollment’, ‘Full time course’, ‘Part time course’)
o	“education_level”: participant's highest education level (categorical: ‘Primary School’, ‘High School’, ‘Graduate’, ‘Masters’, ‘Phd’)
o	“major_discipline”: participant's major discipline in university (categorical: ‘STEM’, ‘Business Degree’, ‘Arts’, ‘Humanities’, ‘No Major’, ‘Other’)
o	“experience”: participant's total experience in years (categorical)
o	“company_size”: number of employees in participant's current employer (categorical: ‘<10’, ‘10/49’, ‘50-99’, ‘100-500’, ‘500-999’, ‘1000-4999’, ‘5000-9999’, ‘10000+’)
o	“company_type”: type of organization where participant is currently working (categorical: ‘Public Sector’, ‘NGO’, ‘Pvt Ltd’, ‘Funded Startup’, ‘Early Stage Startup’, ‘Other’)
o	“last_new_job”: difference in years between previous job and current job (categorical: ‘never’, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘>4’)
o	“training_hours”: number of training hours taken by participant (numeric)
o	“target”: indicates if participant is looking for a new job (numeric: 0 = not looking, 1 = looking)


4.	Data Science Process:

•	Data Preparation:
o	The first step is to gather and clean the data. This involves loading the data into a data frame and checking for missing values and data inconsistencies. In this case, we need to merge the given datasets and also create some additional features from the existing ones. Once we have clean data, we can proceed with exploratory data analysis.

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	In this stage, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify patterns or relationships between variables. We will use various statistical and visualization techniques to examine the distribution of the variables, the correlation between the variables, and any potential outliers or anomalies.

•	Feature Engineering:
o	In this stage, we will create new features or transform existing features to improve the performance of the model. This includes creating interaction terms, transforming variables, and scaling or standardizing the features.
o	We will also conduct feature selection to identify the most important variables that contribute to the prediction of term deposit subscription. We will use techniques and feature importance from the selected model to select the most relevant features.

•	Model Selection:
o	In this stage, we will experiment with several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, and evaluate their performance using cross-validation and various performance metrics such as AUC, precision, recall, and F1 score.
o	We will select the best performing model for further analysis based on its performance on the test dataset.

•	Model Evaluation:
o	In this stage, we will evaluate the performance of the selected model on the test dataset, which was not used during the training or feature selection phase, to assess the generalizability of the model. We will also visualize the results using various metrics such as Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve to better understand the performance of the model and identify any potential areas for improvement.

•	Model Deployment:
o	The final step is to deploy the model into production. This involves setting up a pipeline that can take new data and feed it into the trained model to make predictions. The model needs to be monitored over time to ensure that it continues to perform well and any necessary updates can be made.

Overall, the data science process for the HR Analytics: Job Change involves data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, model evaluation, and model deployment. By following this process, we can build an accurate and robust predictive model for job change of data scientists in various organizations. The insights gained from the model can help organizations improve their employee retention strategies, understand the factors that influence job change, and make data-driven decisions to retain their valuable employees.
